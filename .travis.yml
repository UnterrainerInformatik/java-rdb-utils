# RELEASE           Set to true to release a ZIP-file on github (there has to be a

### Deploy

### GENERAL INFO ###
####################
# - The 'deploy' step in Travis isn't the same process as the rest. So you have to re-source
#   the functions into that process. More than that it isn't a full sh process like with the
#   script-phase. So you cannot even source from there directly. That's why the source
#   command is IN the deploy.sh script.
